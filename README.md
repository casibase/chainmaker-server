# ChainMaker Server

A HTTP service wrapper for ChainMaker SDK, designed to work with Casibase without requiring CGO support.

## Overview

ChainMaker Server is a lightweight HTTP service that provides a bridge between Casibase and ChainMaker blockchain. Instead of directly integrating ChainMaker SDK (which requires CGO), this service offers HTTP endpoints to interact with ChainMaker blockchain, making it more flexible and easier to deploy.

## Features

- RESTful API interface for ChainMaker operations
- Easy integration with Casibase
- No CGO dependency required for client applications

## Compatibility Notice

**Important:**  
Currently, ChainMaker Server only supports ChainMaker blockchains with **TLS disabled** and **authtype set to `permissionedWithCert`**. If you encounter errors when invoking transaction or query APIs, please verify that your ChainMaker server configuration meets these requirements.  
Additionally, ensure that the `provider` configuration in your Casibase setup is consistent with your ChainMaker network settings.

For details on how to check and modify your ChainMaker chain configuration, please refer to the official documentation:  
- [ChainMaker Configuration Guide](https://docs.chainmaker.org.cn/manage/%E9%95%BF%E5%AE%89%E9%93%BE%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE%E7%AE%A1%E7%90%86.html)

If your configuration does not meet the above requirements, the service may not function as expected.

## Technical Stack

- Go 1.22+
- Beego Framework
